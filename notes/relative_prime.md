# 🌟✨ Relatively Prime Numbers ✨🌟

> Think of numbers like adventurers in a fantasy guild. 🛡️⚔️
> Two numbers are **relatively prime** if they share **no prime allies** except the humble **1**.
> In other words, their _greatest common divisor (GCD)_ is **1**. 💎

---

## 🔹 **Definition** 💡

- Two numbers **a** and **b** are relatively prime if:

  ```
  GCD(a, b) = 1
  ```

- Also called **co-prime numbers**.
- They don’t need to be prime themselves—just not share any prime factors. 🌸

## 🔹 **Example 1 – True Friendship** 💕

**Question:** Are 4 and 13 relatively prime?

| Results                       | 4       | 13    |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Divisors                      | 1, 2, 4 | 1, 13 |
| Common Divisors               | 1       | 1     |
| Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) | 1       | 1     |

✨ **GCD(4, 13) = 1 → Yes, they are relatively prime!**
Even though 4 isn’t prime, it still pairs beautifully with 13. A true odd-couple friendship\~ 💖

## 🔹 **Example 2 – Complicated Pair** 😅

**Question:** Are 15 and 21 relatively prime?

| Results                       | 15          | 21          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Divisors                      | 1, 3, 5, 15 | 1, 3, 7, 21 |
| Common Divisors               | 1           | 3           |
| Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) | 3           | 3           |

❌ **GCD(15, 21) = 3 → Not relatively prime.**
Both secretly had a common factor (3), so their bond isn’t pure. 💔

## 🔹 **Quick Reference Table** 📜✨

| a   | b   | GCD(a, b) | Relatively prime? | Remarks                          |
| --- | --- | --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 11  | 17  | 1         | ✔️ Yes            | Both are prime ✨                |
| 11  | 21  | 1         | ✔️ Yes            | One prime, one composite 💡      |
| 12  | 77  | 1         | ✔️ Yes            | Both composite but still work 🌸 |

## 💎 **TL;DR – Magical Recap** ✨

- **Relatively prime** = numbers with no prime factors in common (only **1**).
- **GCD = 1** is the key test 🗝️
- Prime numbers often pair well, but composites can be co-prime too\~
- It’s like testing if two adventurers in the guild share the same guild mark—if not, they’re truly independent allies 🌟
