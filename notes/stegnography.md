# Steganography 🌟

---

### 🕵️‍ **What is Steganography?** 🕵️‍♂️

Steganography is the art of **hiding** the existence of a message! 😲 It's different from encryption, which makes a message unreadable. Steganography **conceals** the fact that a message even exists in the first place! 🕶️

**Key Points:**

- **Not encryption!** It’s about hiding, not scrambling text. 🔐❌
- The goal: Make the message invisible to outsiders. 👀🚫

### 🎨 **Types of Steganography** 🎨

There are several ways to hide your message! Here are some creative methods: 💡✨

- **Character Making**: Tweaking fonts or letters to hide the message. ✏️
- **Invisible Ink**: Writing in ink that can’t be seen without special tools. 🖋️🕵️‍♀️
- **Pin Punctures**: Using tiny pinholes in paper to represent data. 📄💉
- **Typewriter Color Ribbon**: Changing the color ribbon to encode messages in typewritten text. ⌨️🖨️

### ⚠️ **Drawbacks of Steganography** ⚠️

As cool as it is, steganography does have some downsides:

- **Overhead**: Requires extra resources to hide the message. ⏳💻
- **Vulnerability**: If the hiding method is discovered, your secret is out! 😱🔓

> 💡 **Tip**: You can **encrypt** the message **first** and then hide it with steganography for double security! 🔒🎭

### 🖼️ **LSB Steganography** 🖼️

LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography is a sneaky method that hides data in the **least significant bits** of image pixels! 🖼️🧐

- It involves tweaking the last bit of each pixel color (RGB values), which **doesn’t affect** the image’s appearance much but **hides** your message! 🎨💬
- Used widely in digital image files (like PNG or BMP). 📸💾
