# 🔍 **Cryptanalysis (Breaking Encryption)** 🔓

---

## ✅ **What is Cryptanalysis?**

- **Cryptanalysis** is the process of analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems.
- **Cryptanalytic Attack** → Based on the information available to the attacker.
- **Most Difficult Attack** → **Ciphertext-only** (Attacker has only the encrypted text).

## 🔥 **Types of Cryptanalytic Attacks**

| 🛡️ **Attack Type**    | 📌 **What the Attacker Knows**                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ciphertext-Only**   | Encryption Algorithm, Ciphertext (CT)                                                                            |
| **Known Plaintext**   | Encryption Algorithm, Ciphertext (CT), **One or more PT-CT pairs**                                               |
| **Chosen Plaintext**  | Encryption Algorithm, Ciphertext (CT), **Plaintext (PT) chosen by attacker** and its corresponding CT            |
| **Chosen Ciphertext** | Encryption Algorithm, Ciphertext (CT), **Ciphertext (CT) chosen by attacker** and its corresponding decrypted PT |
| **Chosen Text**       | **Both** chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext                                                                  |
