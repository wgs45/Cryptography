## 🧭 **1. Definition: The Enchanted Mirror of Multiplication**

Imagine a magical number that—when multiplied by your chosen number—✨*reflects back to 1*✨ under a certain modulus~

That number is called the **Multiplicative Inverse (M.I.)** 💫

🔹 **Rule of the Spell:**

> A × A⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod n)

💬 *In plain words:*
You’re looking for a number **A⁻¹** that makes the product of **A × A⁻¹** leave a remainder of **1** when divided by **n**.

🧩 Example intuition:

> “Find a number that ‘undoes’ the multiplication of A under modulo n!”

---

## 🌷 **2. Important Reminder (The Law of the Land 🌙)**

A number **A** has a **multiplicative inverse (mod n)** *only if*

> **A and n are coprime** (i.e., gcd(A, n) = 1).

💡 If they share any common factor other than 1... the spell fails! 🪄💨

## 🍀 **3. Sparkling Examples**

Let’s cast a few modular spells together! 🧙‍♀️✨

| 🧮 Equation        | 💫 Check                                | 🌟 Result                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 3 × 2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)  | ✔️ Works!                               | M.I of **3 (mod 5)** is **2**  |
| 2 × 6 ≡ 1 (mod 11) | ✔️ Works!                               | M.I of **2 (mod 11)** is **6** |
| 4 × 4 ≡ 1 (mod 5)  | ✔️ Works!                               | M.I of **4 (mod 5)** is **4**  |
| 5 × 2 ≡ 1 (mod 10) | ❌ Doesn’t work (5 and 10 not coprime!) | ❗ **Undefined**               |

## 🪞 **4. Quick M.I. Lookup Examples**

Let’s test a few by hand~ 💕

✨ For 2 (mod 5):
2 × 3 = 6 → 6 mod 5 = **1** → M.I = **3**

✨ For 2 (mod 7):
2 × 4 = 8 → 8 mod 7 = **1** → M.I = **4**

🎀 See the pattern?
You’re looking for the “partner number” that brings your product neatly back to 1 under that modular world~ 🌏💫

## 🌼 **5. Tiny TL;DR — The Short Spell Scroll 🪶**

| Concept                    | Meaning                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiplicative Inverse** | The number that, when multiplied by A, gives 1 under mod n. |
| **Condition**              | Exists only if gcd(A, n) = 1.                               |
| **Equation**               | A × A⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod n)                                         |
| **Example**                | 2⁻¹ mod 5 = 3, because 2 × 3 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)                |
